## Your Task

We were tasked with writing a javascript coding quiz. This application was to ask a series of questions testing the users knowledge of Javascript. They will then be scored based on the amount of time it took to complete and the amount of correct answers. The user can then add their initials to a high scores chart stored in local storage.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question - DONE
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question - DONE
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock - DONE
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over - DONE
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score - DONE
```
