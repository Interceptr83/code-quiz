# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

We were tasked with writing a javascript coding quiz. This application was to ask a series of questions testing the users knowledge of Javascript. They will then be scored based on the amount of time it took to complete and the amount of correct answers. The user can then add their initials to a high scores chart stored in local storage.
